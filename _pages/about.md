<!-- This is Utkalika Satapathy's home on the web! -->
<br><br>
I am Ph.D. Research Student in the <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in" target=_blank>Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in" target=_blank>Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIT) Kharagpur</a>, West Bengal, India. I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/index.html" target=_blank>Prof. Sandip Chakraborty</a>. I am also a member of the research group <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/index.html" target=_blank>Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)</a>.
<br><br>
My research interests include the areas of Systems, Provenance Tracking, and Distributed systems. Currently exploring Loadable Kernel Module (LKM), Extended Berkeley Packet Filter <a href="https://ebpf.io/" target=_blank>(eBPF)</a>, Linux Security Modules (LSMs).
<br><br>
I have a strong passion for discovering distinctive opportunities, acquiring new skills and knowledge in various technologies, and connecting with diverse individuals. I firmly hold these values and apply them to every facet of my life, both personally and professionally. If you're interested in learning more about me, feel free to continue exploring my website or reach out to me directly.
