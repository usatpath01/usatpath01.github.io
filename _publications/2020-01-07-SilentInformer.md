permalink: /publication/2020-01-07-SilentInformer
excerpt: 'Disbursing information in real-life noisy environ- ments is challenging. The problem gets further compounded when the users of the system are aged or have sensory impaire- ments. We, in this paper, develop a system called SilentInformer, for advanced information sharing ,over smartphones, by exploit- ing inaudible acoustic signals. The results depict the potential of the system by achieving a minimum bit error rate (BER) ≤ 10% with message length ≤ 4 symbols and an average BER ≤ 30% with a message length ≤ 8 symbols, from a distance of 27ft in realistic outdoor conditions.'
