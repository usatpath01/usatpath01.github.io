## Overview

Investigating attacks using Provenance graph over Distributed Microservice architecture

μProv - An application-agnostic framework to capture fine-grained system interactions across microservices leveraging eBPF and constructs dynamic runtime provenance graphs representing the causal relationships between system subjects and objects.

## Key Features

* **Custom eBPF-based logging solution:** μProv consists of a low-overhead logging solution based on the extended Berkeley Packet Filters (eBPF) designed explicitly for distributed microservice environments.

* **Extracting dynamic provenance graphs:** μProv leverages provenance graphs constructed from low-level system events to detect vulnerabilities while effectively illustrating the causal relationships between processes, file accesses, and network activities, providing a holistic view of system behavior.

* **Vulnerability integration in microservices and dataset generation:** We integrate real-world attack scenarios with known vulnerabilities into our system to evaluate its effectiveness. We have developed "PicShare", a PoC microservice web application that enables users to upload, view, and receive picture recommendations.
